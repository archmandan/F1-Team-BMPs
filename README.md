## 🔧 How to Flash a Logo

Flashing a custom logo is super easy and doesn’t require downloading anything from your radio.

### Steps:

1. 📥 Download and install the [Baofeng CPS software](https://www.baofengradio.co.uk/software/)  
   → Be sure to select the **UV-5RH** version
2. 🔌 Connect your radio to your PC via a Baofeng-compatible programming cable
3. 🧭 In CPS, go to:  
   `Tools` → `Power On Picture`
4. 📡 Select the correct **COM port**
5. 🖼️ Click **Import Image**, then choose a BMP from this repo
6. 🚀 Click **Import** to flash the logo
7. 🔄 Turn your radio off and back on to enjoy the drip

> 💡 **Tip:** If the image doesn’t appear and your radio keeps the default splash, try re-importing the BMP or double-checking the image size and format.
